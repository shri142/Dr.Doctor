## Motivation
The antibiotic resistance is a serious issue in our country. A concern amount of children in born in our country with antibiotic resistance. Their parents are responsible for this. When we take antibiotic irregularly the gradually our body became antibiotic resistance and our children also born with antibiotic resistance. People take antibiotic without prescription and there are some people selling this medicine without any prescription. There are some other medicines that can be used for intoxication. If we can get information about those who are selling medicine without prescription then we can stop them. This inspire us to work on this project.
